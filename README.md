# Replication-Materials


This repository contains replication materials for submitted manuscripts. The files are created in Quarto using R programming. I recommend cloning the repository and examining the analysis using the html file. The file also contains a renv lock file that creates a reproducible environment, read more [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). 

Please reach out if you have any questions.
